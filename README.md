# Building-a-Programming-Language-Using-Flex & Bison

## Description
This project demonstrates the usage of Flex and Bison for lexical analysis and parsing in a C++ project. Flex is used for generating a lexical analyzer, while Bison is used for generating a parser. The project showcases how to integrate Flex, Bison, and C++ to build a compiler or interpreter for a specific language or grammar.
